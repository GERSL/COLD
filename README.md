# COLD
Algorithm for COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) using Landsat time series. It can detect many kinds of land disturbance continuously as new images are collected and provide historical land disturbance maps retrospectively.
Please contact Zhe Zhu (zhe@uconn.edu) at Department of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Connecticut if you have any questions.

To stack the Landsat data into BIP format as the the input of the COLD algorithem, please check out the **autoPrepareDataARD.m** (if Landsat ARD) or **autoPrepareDataESPA.m** (if ESPA surface reflectance) in the [CCDC package](https://github.com/GERSL/CCDC).
